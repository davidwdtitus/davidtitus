  <p style="margin-top: 0;"> I estimate impact of Universal E-Verify laws on the college attendance of undocumented Hispanics in the United States. I do so by implementing a series of event studies that account for staggered adoption over time, and I use a random forest algorithm as my primary approach for predicting undocumented status. My results indicate that Universal E-Verify laws lower the college attendance of undocumented Hispanics ages 18-25 by approximately 3 percentage points. This is a large effect, given that only 20.9 percent of undocumented immigrants ages 18-25 either were attending or had completed at least some college education. This effect is also robust to using non-citizen Hispanics as a proxy group without random forest, testing for potential spillovers to bordering states, and considering any potentially confounding impact of other state-level policies. I explore potential mechanisms by developing a model explaining avenues through which Universal E-Verify can affect college education, and I test this modelâ€™s implications. I find suggestive evidence that the negative effect on college education is driven by worse labor market outcomes for undocumented parents, which render future prospects for college less attainable for undocumented children. These results indicate that employment restrictions on undocumented immigrants produce detrimental effects on their human capital accumulation.  </p>
